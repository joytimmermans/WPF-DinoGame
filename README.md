# DinoRun

This is a game based of the google chrome game. A classmate and I created this for our final project in high school. This is a WPF program and everything scales to your native screen resolution. 

Since there is not a lot of games written in a WPF project i thought i would share this one. Be aware that a lot of things are poorly written since this was just in high school and a lot of optimisation could be done
